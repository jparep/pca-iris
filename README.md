# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset to reduce its dimensions and visualize the results. PCA is a statistical technique used to simplify a dataset by reducing its dimensions while preserving as much variability as possible.

## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system. The new coordinates (principal components) are chosen to capture the maximum variance in the data.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset has three classes, each representing a different species of iris.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage

To perform PCA on the Iris dataset and visualize the results, run the pca_iris.py script:
```sh
python pca_iris.py
```
